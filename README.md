Project: Study on Dressing Behavior of an Autistic Man
Introduction
This README document provides an overview of a short-term study conducted over three months (May, June, and July 2023) to monitor the dressing behavior of a 28-year-old autistic man who had a severe case of self-harm and spent most of his time naked in his house. The study aimed to understand his behavior and reaction when prompted to dress up, with the goal of helping him maintain his dignity and improve his well-being.

Background
The participant, a 28-year-old autistic man, had a history of severe self-harm and exhibited a preference for spending most of his time naked in his house. This behavior raised concerns about his safety, dignity, and social integration. As part of efforts to support his well-being, a short-term study was initiated to observe his dressing behavior and assess the effectiveness of interventions aimed at encouraging him to dress up.

Methodology
The study was conducted over a period of three months, from May to July 2023. Observations were made daily, and data was recorded regarding the participant's dressing behavior, reactions to prompts to dress up, and any changes or trends observed over time.

Results
After three months of monitoring and intervention, notable changes were observed in the participant's dressing behavior. While initially resistant to dressing up, the participant gradually started accepting and even embracing the practice of dressing when indoors. Graphical representations of the data collected throughout the study period are presented below:



Conclusion
The findings of the study suggest that with consistent prompting and support, individuals with autism and severe self-harm tendencies can exhibit positive changes in their behavior, including their dressing habits. The participant's increased acceptance of dressing up indoors is a promising development that could contribute to his overall well-being and social integration. Further research and continued support are recommended to sustain and build upon these positive changes.
